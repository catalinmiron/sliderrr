# Sliderrr

A collaborative dribbble viewer.

Check out the demo site: [sliderrr.iestynwilliams.net](http://sliderrr.iestynwilliams.net).

#### Tech:

- Node with Express & Socket.io on the server
- React + Flux & Socket.io on the client
- Stylus-compiling middleware on the server

#### Why?

One of the designers at work said it would be cool to have a dribbble feed on one of our TVs, so I thought I'd have a go at building one.
I'm always looking for an excuse to grok new technologies, and React+Flux are very interesting to me at the moment. I've also never really used web sockets before, so wanted to try them out.
