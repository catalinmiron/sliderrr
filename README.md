# Sliderrr

A collaborative dribbble viewer.

#### Tech:

- Node with Express & Socket.io on the server
- React + Flux & Socket.io on the client
- Stylus-compiling middleware on the server

#### Why?

I'm always looking for an excuse to grok new technologies, and one thing that was suggested at work was to have a dribbble feed on one of the TVs.
So that's step 1, but then I started thinking "How could you interact with it?" â€” hence step 2 with socket.io!

## Animation TODO

- Bigshot when it changes
- Shotties when changing the bigshot
- Adding of new shotties

### Getting it up and running

1. `git clone git@github.com:iest/sliderrr.git`
2. `cd sliderrr`
3. `npm install`
4. `node server.js`
